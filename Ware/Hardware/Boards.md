### Microprocessor Controller
Like a mechanical clock, it has an electronic clock that ticks away and an electronic counter which counts the electronic ticks, therefore the passage of time.

Take a washing machine, it has programs and sequences for each type of cycle which is stored in the microprocessorâ€™s memory.

Carries out logical processes (and more).

### Sensors
Senses things such as weight, volume, temperature, pressure, etc.
