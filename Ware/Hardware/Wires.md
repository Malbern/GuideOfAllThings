####Coaxial Cabling
####Info
A coaxial cable has an internal conductor that runs down the middle of the cable.

Coaxial cable is often used to carry TV signals throughout a home, although it can carry many types of signals, including audio and data signals.

####Coax Connector
Coaxial connectors are components attached to the end of a coaxial cable. The most common use for coaxial cables and connectors is to carry radio frequency signals, also called RF signals. 
####Twisted Pair Cabling
The twisted-room has four pairs of wires. These wires are twisted almost to each other to reduce crosstalk and external interference.
