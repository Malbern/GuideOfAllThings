iOS
ap1, en0, en1 are names of the interfaces on iOS as well as on Mac. If you type in Terminal on Mac ifconfig you would get the same, en0, en1, etc. pdp_ip interfaces are those that are used for 3G and cellular data, while ap1 is used to represent currently active data connection, Wi-Fi, cellular data or bluetooth.

Loopback
Loopback (also written loop-back) is the routing of electronic signals or digital data streams back to their source without intentional processing or modification. It is primarily a means of testing the communications infrastructure.

Loopback IP address is managed entirely by and within the operating system. These addresses enable the Server and Client processes on a single system to communicate with each other. When a process creates a packet with destination address as loopback address, the operating system loops it back to itself without having any interference of NIC.

Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)
In computing, Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a secure network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts the packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network. It is used in virtual private networks (VPNs).

Localhost
In computer networking, localhost is a hostname that refers to the current computer used to access it. It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.

Wireless LAN (WLAN)
A WLAN, or wireless LAN, is a network that allows devices to connect and communicate wirelessly . Unlike a traditional wired LAN, in which devices communicate over Ethernet cables, devices on a WLAN communicate via Wi-Fi. While a WLAN may look different than a traditional LAN, it functions the same way.

Website Data
Unknown as of right now, believed to be a type of cache system that allows for the websites to remember certain details.

#Networking
Interfaces or protocols that are used in networking to provide functionality, accessibility, security, communication, etc.

Addresses
Multicast Address
SSDP Address
Broadcast Address
Node-Local Multicast Address
Link-Local Multicast Address
Link-Local Address

Protocols
What seems to make networking actually networking. The underlying protocols that brings everything together and allows functionality by providing a foundation and system.

Kerberos
 is a computer network security protocol that authenticates service requests between two or more trusted hosts across an untrusted network, like the internet. It uses secret-key cryptography and a trusted third party for authenticating client-server applications and verifying usersâ€™ identities

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

Internet Protocol Suite
Internet Protocol (IP)

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
In computer networking, the User Datagram Protocol is one of the core members of the Internet protocol suite. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol network.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
The Transmission Control Protocol is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol. Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.
