# Precaution
WARNING - Most, if not all (Might as well be better safe than sorry.) things that has anything to do with electricity can and will hurt and/or kill you if you give it a chance. Know your surroundings and know your safety. Always properly ground yourself, discharge anything that holds any type of energy, make sure there’s nothing running through, and lock it out.

## Resistance

### Precaution
WARNING - Never measure resistance on a circuit with voltage running through it.

##Alternating Current(AC)

###Info
Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction.

AC current is generally used to power homes and businesses, and is also present when audio and radio signals are carried on electrical wires.

It starts, say, from zero, grows to a maximum, decreases to zero, reverses, reaches a maximum in the opposite direction, returns again to the original value, and repeats this cycle indefinitely.

An alternating current has a wide advantage over DC as AC is able to transmit power over large distances without great loss of energy.

Hence, the voltage through transmission lines is very high, which reduces the current, which in turn minimizes the energy lost through transmission. This is why alternating current is preferred over direct current for transmitting electricity, as it is much cheaper to change the voltage of an alternating current.

A major advantage of alternating current is that its voltage can be modified relatively easily using a transformer, which allows power to be transmitted at very high voltages before being taken down to safer voltages for commercial and residential use.

 Economical and simple production.
Low-waste energy-transmission in large distances.
Easy transformation into other types based on the principle of mutual induction.
The sinusoidal type is not varied by the main components, including L, R, and C.

Electronic devices and equipment such as radios, lamps, motors, televisions, and other home appliances directly use AC power for their operation. Meanwhile, DC power is commonly used in consumer electronics.

### AC Power Source
An AC power source supplies an alternating electrical current that helps power or test a separate piece of equipment by simulating electrical grid interruptions, harmonics, surges, or other events that could cause a device under test (DUT) to malfunction.

### AC Supply
If a supply has a frequency of 50Hz (50 hertz), that means it changes direction and back again 50 times a second.

### AC Load
The AC load can be capacitive, inductive or resistive but the load on DC is always resistive.



## Direct Current(DC)

### Info
In direct current, the voltage is always constant, and the electricity flows in a certain direction.

DC current is typical of batteries that power flashlights and other home appliances and is also used in some industrial applications.

Direct current is used in any electronic device with a battery for a power source. It is also used to charge batteries, so rechargeable devices like laptops and cell phones come with an AC adapter that converts alternating current to direct current.

DC power is widely used in low voltage applications such as charging batteries, automotive applications, aircraft applications and other low voltage, low current applications. All solar panels nowadays produce DC power.

That is why portable electronics – flashlights, cell phones, laptops – use DC power; they have to store it. Plug-in vehicles are portable so they use DC batteries too (although most of them have AC motors – a complicating step we may consider another day.
