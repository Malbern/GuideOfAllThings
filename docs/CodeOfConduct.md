Whoever we may be or not be, we have a way of doing things.
That way things can be kept short and sweet.
Do what's right and be decent.

If you can't be nice, it's simple. Mind your own business.
Don't ever pity another, but yet empathasize.
Stand up for what you believe in and don't let others fall.

Don't tolerate what can't be stood. Always try. You can't do unless you try.
Good looking out is what it stands for.

If you can be mean and make us like you, hooray for us all.
Let's make this world a better place.
