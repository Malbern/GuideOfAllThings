# Malbern's Way

To maintain our integrity and independence, with way to the open-source way...

In all that is righteous so that this is short and sweet..

Permission is hereby granted to do whatever you want with whatever may pertain here.

All that's asked is that you don't use it in any negative way, and so here's in good faith.

Good looking out is what it's about and there is not a single doubt.

No liability or responsibility here. Have a good day.

Just because you can use it though doesn't mean it's yours just like what is used here may not be ours.

Just be decent and do what's right.
